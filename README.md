# Spark-AR

This repo contains the project files for the projects which I have worked on during the Facebook AR hackathon.

The projects are created using Spark AR. 

In the projects, I have used plane tracker, face tracker, and have worked with 3d objects and have tried to animate them for a wonderful user experience.

Using the plane tracker, whenever a plane is detected, the 3d object is placed on the plane, which results in the user to experience a 3d object placed in his own surrounding environment.

Using the face tracker, I have created some face deformation animations and using face tracker along with plane occluder, I have created an amazing effect.

I have also used segmentation to change the background and also I have added animation using gifs.
